1,4001,Quad 2-Input NOR Buffered B Series Gate,The CD4001BC and CD4011BC quad gates are monolithic complementary MOS (CMOS) integrated circuits constructed with N- and P-channel enhancement mode transistors. They have equal source and sink current capabilities and conform to standard B series output drive. The devices also have buffered outputs which improve transfer characteristics by providing very high gain.,Yes,No,https://www.futurlec.com/4000Series/CD4001.shtml
2,4002,Dual 4-Input NOR Gate,These NOR and NAND gates are monolithic complementary MOS (CMOS) integrated circuits. The N- and P-channel enhancement mode transistors provide a symmetrical circuit with output swings essentially equal to the supply voltage. This results in high noise immunity over a wide supply voltage range. No DC power other than that caused by leakage current is consumed during static conditions. All inputs are protected against static discharge and latching conditions.,Yes,No,https://www.futurlec.com/4000Series/CD4002.shtml

8,4013,Dual D-Type Flip-Flop,"The CD4013B dual D-type flip-flop is a monolithic complementary MOS (CMOS) integrated circuit constructed with N- and P-channel enhancement mode transistors. Each flip-flop has independent data, set, reset, and clock inputs and “Q” and “Q” outputs. These devices can be used for shift register applications, and by connecting “Q” output to the data input, for counter and toggle applications. The logic level present at the “D” input is transferred to the Q output during the positive-going transition of the clock pulse. Setting or resetting is independent of the clock and is accomplished by a high level on the set or reset line respectively",Yes,Yes,https://www.futurlec.com/4000Series/CD4013.shtml
