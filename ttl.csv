60,74LS381,4-Bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) / Function Generator,"The 74LS381 is a 4-bit ALU that performs a variety of arithmetic and logic operations on two 4-bit words, selectable via function control inputs. It can add, subtract, compare, and perform logic functions like AND, OR, and XOR. The device provides outputs for the result, carry, overflow, and propagate/generate signals, making it suitable for use in small-scale processors and digital systems requiring fast parallel arithmetic and logic operations.",Yes,Yes,https://shop.griederbauteile.ch/info/7/74LS381.pdf
61,74LS393,Dual 4-Bit Binary Counter,"The 74LS393 contains two independent 4-bit binary counters in a single package. Each counter has its own clear and clock inputs and counts in binary from 0 to 15. The counters can be cascaded for longer sequences, and parallel outputs are available from each stage for flexible timing and frequency division in digital systems.",Yes,Yes,https://www.futurlec.com/74LS/74LS393.shtml
62,74LS461,8-Bit Synchronous Counter with Parallel Load,"The 74LS461 is an 8-bit synchronous counter that supports parallel load, clear, hold, and increment operations, all controlled by function select inputs. The counter can be expanded by cascading multiple ICs, features TRI-STATE outputs for bus interfacing, and is commonly used for microprogram counters, DMA controllers, and general-purpose counting applications.",Yes,Yes,https://datasheet4u.com/pdf-down/D/M/7/DM74LS461_NationalSemiconductor.pdf
63,74LS465,Octal TRI-STATE Buffer (Non-Inverting),"The 74LS465 is an octal (8-channel) non-inverting buffer with TRI-STATE outputs, allowing data to be passed or isolated from the bus. All eight buffers share a common enable line, and the outputs go to high-impedance when disabled. It is used for buffering and driving data on shared buses in digital systems.",Yes,Yes,https://www.mgelectronic.rs/ProductFilesDownload?Id=4342
64,74LS469,8-Bit Synchronous Up/Down Counter with Parallel Load,"The 74LS469 is an 8-bit synchronous up/down counter with parallel load and hold functions. It can increment or decrement its count, load a preset value, or hold its current value, all controlled by function-select inputs. Outputs are TRI-STATE for bus compatibility, and the IC is suitable for microprogram counters, DMA controllers, and general-purpose up/down counting.",Yes,Yes,https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/88918/FAIRCHILD/DM74LS469.html
